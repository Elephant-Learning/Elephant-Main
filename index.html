                <h1>The Ultimate Student Suite</h1>
                <p>Elephant was built around making students' lives easier and more fun. This service was built and designed by high-school-students who know students' needs, and how other services may fail to fulfill them!</p>

            <h1>Fast And Secure</h1>
            <p>Despite having a clean and modern UI, Elephant was designed to run fast on almost any computer. Also, we track pretty much nothing. The only thing we track is how many users clicked on our website in a day!</p>

            <h1>Advanced Features</h1>
            <p>Being developed by students means more useful features that will actually be helpful. For example, we added the ability to assign multiple definitions to one term in "Elephant Flashcards". This feature is useful for flashcards along the lines of "Name the 3 reasons for...". We added more features as useful as this one to ensure nothing hinders your education! To see all features, visit our documentation.</p>
