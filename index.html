                    <h1>Impressively Useful</h1>
                    <p>Elephant is an impressively useful tool for any student. It turned out to be quite helpful for many classes, allowing me to quickly memorize key terms and events using flashcards and to organize them so I could quickly revisit them when necessary. I strongly recommend Elephant, as it provides a free and effective alternative to other expensive solutions, I was surprised since free apps are generally of lower quality than their paid counterparts but this could not be further from the truth for Elephant.</p>
